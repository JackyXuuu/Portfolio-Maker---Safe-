After that, we loop through the result to ignore any delisted tickers, tickers that are not dominated in the US market, and tickers that fail to meet the average daily volume requirement. We store the ticker name and the closing price on 2021-11-26 into a data frame called ticker_info.  "

    "### Strategy Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting this project, we began by developing a strategy. Our first step was to extract the stock data from the csv file. Next, we had to filter through the stocks. We were given two restrictions. The first was to only include stocks dominated in USD (US listed stocks). The second was to only include stocks in our portfolio that have an average daily volume of at least 10,000 shares, based on the time interval of July 02, 2021 to October 22, 2021. We created a function that could filter through the csv file to only include stocks in the US market and meet the average daily volume requirement. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we had to find a way to choose and rank our stocks so we could later assign each stock weights. We decided to use standard deviation and beta to rank our stocks. Standard deviation would tell us which stocks are the least risky. Beta is the risk related to the overall market, so we decided it was important to take beta into consideration when ranking our stocks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "After choosing and pairing our stocks based on standard deviation and beta, we wanted to pair the stocks based on correlation. Since we want to reduce the risk of our portfolio, we ideally wanted the pairs to be negatively correlated. Of course, this is not possible, so we simply want the pairs to have the least possible correlation. So, we wanted a function that would choose 10 pairs of stocks. Stock 1 in each individual pair would be one of the top 10 ranked stocks, while stock 2 would be the stock that has the least correlation with stock 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "After we have the 10 pairs of stocks, we want to create a portfolio for each pair. Then, we can find the optimal weight that produces the minimal difference between the portfolio value and $100,000. This is our ultimate goal.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The final part is to calculate the weight of each stock that would minimize the total differences. \n",
    "We first loop through the pairs to store their differences, then assign different weights for the pairs with positive differences and negative differences so that they counterbalance each other. Another requirement we we have is we need to ensure that each stock is in the range (100/2n %, 35%). After completing this, we can finally apply the weights of each pair to get the final weight for each stock and build the final portfolio accordingly.\n",

    "In the graph above, we can see that the standard deviation rankings have an upward moving trend, whereas beta rankings have no trend. The graph shows that stocks with a higher standard deviation ranking are ranked higher overall. This is because we know that stocks with a higher deviation are riskier. Although the beta rankings do not seem to affect the final ranking (because there is no trend), they must be considered because beta is the market-related risk, as discussed earlier."

    "#### For loop explained:\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to produce the optimal portfolio value with a return on investment as close to 0 dollar as possible, we would have to allocate varying percentages of our investment into different stocks. Since we have paired the twenty stocks we would invest into by their correlation, we would have to determine how much of our investment would go into each stock so that each pair would balance out and return the lowest difference in price. This is done through the create_portfolio function. \n",
    "The purpose of the for loop outside of main function is to vary the range of the weightings by increasing the minimum weighting and the maximum weighting. In specific, the loop will start at a minimum weighting of 1\\% and a maximum weighting of 99\\% (a range of 98\\%) and finish its iterations at a minimum weighting of 49\\% and a maximum weighting of to 51\\% (so a range of 2\\%).  For each iteration, we compare the current portfolio value of the current minimum and maximum weighting against the lowest portfolio value so far. If the current portfolio value is closer to $100,000 by the last date, lowest will be replaced by the current portfolio with its current minimum and maximum weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inside the for loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the range of weightings, we calculate the optimal weight for each stock within the range and using the weight to calculate the final portfolio value. The porfolio value that is closest to $100,000 would be stored. \n",
    "\n",
    "We first collect the information we need, which is the optimal weight and minimal difference of each pair, through the create_portfolio function. Then, we store this information into a data frame called weights, and separate the pairs according to the sign of their differences into two portfolios: pos_diff and neg_diff. Our goal is to weigh the positive differences and the negative differences to a 50-50 percentage to cancel each other, and at the same time ensure that these weights would also produce the final weight of each stock in the range of (100/2n %, 35 percent %). We started by calculating the maximum and minimum weight of each stock, which then allows us to calculate the optimal weight that counterbalances the positive and negative differences to the greatest extent. Once we have the weights for positive and negative differences, we apply that to each pair and get the final weight of each stock. Then we build the final portfolio using the final weight and check the difference between the final portfolio value and $100,000.  "

    "<span style=\"color:red\"> We got zero shares for the first two tickers in the final portfolio, and the issue we found was the start date. In order to analyze the risk of the stocks, we extracted historical data of the tickers from 2021-07-22 to 2021-10-22. We were assuming that the stocks have available data within this time frame. As a result, when our code ran on the stocks that do not have available data in that time period(which is shown below), the result did not work as we expected. </span>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:red\">To fix this problem, we add an extra filter in the get_ticker_info function(code block #2, 16) that check if the stock have available data on 2021-07-22. By doing this, we only consider the stock that has available data in our desired time frame so that such error would not appear again. \n",
    "Another solution is to just change our start date to 2021-08-01, but that does not guarantee the output if we are given different tickers, so the first solution would be better. </span>\n",
