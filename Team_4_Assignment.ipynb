    "    Before starting this project, we began by developing a strategy. Our first step was to extract the stock data from the csv file. Next, we had to filter through the stocks. We were given two restrictions. The first was to only include stocks dominated in USD (US listed stocks). The second was to only include stocks in your portfolio that have an average daily volume of at least 10,000 shares, based on the time interval of July 02, 2021 to October 22, 2021. We created a function that could filter through the csv file to only include stocks in the US market and meet the average daily volume requirement. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Next, we had to find a way to choose and rank our stocks so we could later assign each stock weights. We decided to use standard deviation and beta to rank our stocks. Standard deviation would tell us which stocks are the least risky. Beta is the risk related to the overall market, so we decided it was important to take beta into consideration when ranking our stocks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    After choosing and pairing our stocks based on standard deviation and beta, we wanted to pair the stocks based on correlation. Since we want to reduce the risk of our portfolio, we ideally wanted the pairs to be negatively correlated. Of course, this is not possible, so we simply want the pairs to have the least possible correlation. So, we wanted a function that would choose 10 pairs of stocks. Stock 1 in each individual pair would be one of the top 10 ranked stocks, while stock 2 would be the stock that has the least correlation with stock 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "    After we have the 10 pairs of stocks, we want to create a portfolio for each pair. Then, we can find the optimal weight that produces the minimal difference between the portfolio value and $100,000. This is our ultimate goal.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    We first collect the information we need, which is the optimal weight and minimal difference of each pair, through the create_portfolio function. Then, we store this information into a data frame called weights, and separate the pairs according to the sign of their differences into two portfolios: pos_diff and neg_diff. Our goal is to weigh the positive differences and the negative differences to a 50-50 percentage to cancel each other, and at the same time ensure that these weights would also produce the final weight of each stock in the range of  (). We started by calculating the maximum and minimum weight of each stock, which then allows us to calculate the optimal weight that counterbalances the positive and negative differences to the greatest extent. Once we have the weights for positive and negative differences, we apply that to each pair and get the final weight of each stock. Then we build the final portfolio using the final weight and check the difference between the final portfolio value and $100,000.  "
